Save you configurationfile as `server.config.json` in `branding/common/config`.

Add you Installation id to the `config.json` file in your brand (eg. branding/brands/vanilla/config.json).

### Add you mapbox key to environement

Copy and edit the template of `.env.exmaple` and add your Mapbox key. Add your key and save your environementfile as `.env` in the root directory.

```
MAPBOX_API_KEY="AddYourKeyHere"
PRODUCTION="true"

### Install Brand

```bash
npm run setbrand -- --brand="IACUBUS"
```

or

[Choose your brand, following the README.md in the branding folder.](../blob/main/branding/README.md)

### Install Platforms

```bash
npx ionic cordova prepare ios
npx ionic cordova prepare android
```

### Debug Build

The iOS app can be build with the following command.

```bash
npx ionic cordova build ios
```

The Android can be build with the same command.

```bash
npx ionic cordova build android
```

### Run in Simulator/Emulator

The iOS app can be build and run in simulator with the Xcode app.

The Android can be build and run in emulator in Android Studio.

## Run the Tests

### Lint

The linter can be run as shown bellow.

```bash
npm run tslint
```

A lot of old code does not comply with the new code style rules checked by tslint, which
result in a lot of warnings.

### Unit tests

The unit tests can be run with the command shown bellow.

```bash
npm run karma:singlerun
```

If karma should keep running after the tests use the following command.

```bash
npm run karma
```

## Deployment

```bash
npx ionic cordova build ios --prod --release
```

Open your Xcode Workspace (the YourAppName.xcworkspace in ./platforms/ios) and set **_Certifacates_**, your **_Team ID_**, set the `iOS Deployment Target` to `14.0` (in `CordovaLib->Build Settings`) and Release it to the AppStore.

Check here for information about Certificates: https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/

And Check the ionic docs: https://ionicframework.com/docs/deployment/app-store

As soon as you have all your profiles create an Archive in `Xcode -> Product -> Archive` and upload it to the Appstore.

### Android
